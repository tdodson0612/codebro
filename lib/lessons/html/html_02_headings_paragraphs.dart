  title: 'Headings, Paragraphs, and Text',
  content: """
🎯 METAPHOR:
Headings are like the table of contents in a spectacular
coffee-table book. h1 is the title on the cover — bold,
unmissable, one per book. h2 are the chapter titles.
h3 are the section headers within chapters. All the way
down to h6, which is a tiny footnote heading that almost
nobody uses. The hierarchy creates the OUTLINE of your page.
Search engines read it. Screen readers navigate by it.
It is the most important structural decision you make.

📖 EXPLANATION:
HEADINGS — six levels of importance:
  <h1> Most important — page title, use ONCE per page
  <h2> Section headings
  <h3> Sub-section headings
  <h4> Sub-sub-section headings
  <h5> Rarely used
  <h6> Almost never used

Do NOT choose headings based on size — use CSS for that.
Choose headings based on HIERARCHY and MEANING.

TEXT ELEMENTS:
  <p>         paragraph — block of text, auto spacing
  <br>        line break — void element
  <hr>        horizontal rule / thematic break — void element
  <strong>    important text (bold by default)
  <em>        emphasized text (italic by default)
  <b>         bold — stylistic, not semantic
  <i>         italic — stylistic, not semantic
  <u>         underline — avoid (confused with links)
  <s>         strikethrough
  <mark>      highlighted text
  <small>     smaller text / fine print
  <sub>       subscript (H₂O)
  <sup>       superscript (E=mc²)
  <code>      inline code
  <pre>       preformatted text (preserves whitespace)
  <kbd>       keyboard input
  <samp>      sample output
  <var>       variable in code/math
  <abbr>      abbreviation with title
  <cite>      citation of creative work
  <q>         inline quotation
  <blockquote> block quotation
  <time>      machine-readable date/time
  <address>   contact information

    Coffee was first discovered in the highlands of Ethiopia,
    where goats were observed dancing after eating berries
    from a certain tree. Their herder, Kaldi, reported this
    to the local monastery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The monks made a drink from the berries and found that
    it kept them alert during long evening prayers.

📝 KEY POINTS:
✅ Use ONE <h1> per page — it tells search engines what the page is about
✅ Never skip heading levels (h1 → h3) — maintain logical hierarchy
✅ <strong> means importance; <b> means bold — prefer semantic elements
✅ <em> means emphasis; <i> means italic — prefer semantic elements
✅ <time datetime="..."> makes dates machine-readable for SEO and assistive tech
✅ <blockquote> is for long quotes; <q> for inline quotes
❌ Don't use headings to make text bigger — use CSS font-size
❌ Don't use <br> to create spacing between paragraphs — use CSS margin
